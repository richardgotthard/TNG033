Programming in C++, Linköping University 2020.

Labb 1 - 
• Using pointers and dynamic memory allocation/deallocation. 
• Implement a dynamic data structure: singly linked list class.
• Create classes with overloaded operators and use deep copying of objects.

Lab 2 -
• base-classes and derived classes,
• class inheritance,
• polymorphism, dynamic binding, and virtual functions,
• abstract classes, and
• operator overloading: operator+=, operator+, operator[], and
operator().

Lab 3 -

• to use different container classes;
• to use iterators;
• to use algorithms;
• to use std::string-class as a container class; and
• to get acquainted with the online library documentation,
o cppreference.com (see sections under “Containers library”, “Algorithms
library”, “Iterators library”, and “Numerics library”)
• to define and use function objects (and/or lambda functions) to customize algorithms
from the standard library.
