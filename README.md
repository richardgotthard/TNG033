# TNG033
Programming in C++, Linköping University 2020.

Labb 1 - <br />
• Using pointers and dynamic memory allocation/deallocation. <br />
• Implement a dynamic data structure: singly linked list class.<br />
• Create classes with overloaded operators and use deep copying of objects.<br />

Lab 2 - <br />
• base-classes and derived classes,<br />
• class inheritance,<br />
• polymorphism, dynamic binding, and virtual functions,<br />
• abstract classes, and<br />
• operator overloading: operator+=, operator+, operator[], and
operator().<br />

Lab 3 -

• to use different container classes;<br />
• to use iterators;  <br />
• to use algorithms; <br />
• to use std::string-class as a container class; and <br />
• to get acquainted with the online library documentation, 
o cppreference.com (see sections under “Containers library”, “Algorithms 
library”, “Iterators library”, and “Numerics library”) <br />
• to define and use function objects (and/or lambda functions) to customize algorithms
from the standard library. <br />
